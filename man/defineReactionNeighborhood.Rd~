\title{Creates a set of sample path p-values for each length given a weighted network.}
\description{Randomly traverses paths of increasing lengths within a set network to create an empirical pathway distribution for more accurate determination of path significance.}

\usage{
neighbor.network <- defineReactionNeighborhood(rnet,edge.weights,seed,range,ann = "GRFT",mode = "out")
}
\arguments{
\item{rnet}{The result from makeReactionNetwork.}
\item{edge.weights{The result from computeMaxReactionCorrelations.}
\item{seed}{The starting compound for the scope analysis.}
\item{range}{The maximum scope size.}
\item{ann}{Not used anymore.}
\item{mode}{The mode arguement of the neighborhood function in the igraph package.  The default is "out" which follows all outwards paths from the seed compound.}
}
\value{
A network object suitable for scope analysis.

Hmmm nothing really here.
